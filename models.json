The background is a blurred, smoky hut interior, with the warm glow of a cooking fire reflecting in the subject's dark, soulful eyes. Shot on a Leica M6 with Kodak Portra 400 film grain aesthetic.",

The focus is a young woman with brightly dyed pink-gold hair and freckled skin, looking directly and intently into the camera lens with a hopeful yet slightly uncertain smile, she is slightly off-center. She wears an oversized, vintage band t-shirt that says \"Replicate\" (slightly worn) over a long-sleeved striped top and simple silver stud earrings. The lighting is soft, golden hour sunlight streaming through a slightly dusty window, creating lens flare and illuminating dust motes in the air. The background shows a blurred, cluttered bedroom with posters on the wall and fairy lights, rendered with a shallow depth of field. Natural film grain, a warm, slightly muted color palette, and sharp focus on her expressive eyes enhance the intimate, authentic feel",
