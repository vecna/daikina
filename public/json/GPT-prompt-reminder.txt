You are helping me maintain a JSON catalog of Replicate text-to-image models.

Task:
Rebuild from scratch an updated JSON array of models with the schema:

[
  {
    "model": "producer/model-name",
    "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "cost": 0.04,
    "imagesPerDollar": 25.0,
    "page": "https://replicate.com/producer/model-name",
    "description": "Short description from the model page"
  },
  ...
]

Data source:
- Browse to this collection page and follow all relevant links:
  https://replicate.com/collections/text-to-image

Inclusion rules (IMPORTANT):
1. Only include models that are **official** on Replicate (i.e. have the “Official” badge or are clearly the primary, publisher-backed listing from Google, Black Forest Labs, Ideogram, Recraft, etc.).
2. Only include models that are **warm** (show up as warm/low-latency deployments on Replicate, not cold/archived).
3. Only include models that are **meant to produce pictures from a text prompt**:
   - Text → image or text+image → image.
   - Exclude: video models, pure image editors that don’t accept a text prompt, LLMs, trainers, utilities, etc.

Fields (how to fill them):

- `"model"`:  
  Use the exact `owner/model` identifier as used in the Replicate API, e.g. `"google/imagen-4-ultra"`.

- `"page"`:  
  The canonical Replicate page for that model, e.g. `"https://replicate.com/google/imagen-4-ultra"`.

- `"description"`:  
  Take a short description from the model’s page (the main tagline or summary).  
  Paraphrase if necessary, but keep it concise (1–2 sentences max).

- `"updated"`:  
  Use the **last update date** for the model as shown on the Replicate model page (e.g. the “Updated” field, changelog, or similar).  
  Format it as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.  
  If you only find a month/year, infer a reasonable day (e.g. the 1st) and state it consistently.

- `"cost"` (float):  
  I want the cost **per generated image in USD**, as a float.  
  - Prefer the price explicitly given on the Replicate model page or pricing section (e.g. “$0.04 / image”).
  - If pricing is given in another unit (e.g. per 1,000 images, per 1M tokens, etc.), convert it to a **per-image** cost.
  - Use a reasonable estimate to 4 decimal places if needed, e.g. `0.0400`.

- `"imagesPerDollar"` (float):  
  Compute how many images can be generated for $1 using:
  `imagesPerDollar = 1.0 / cost`
  Round to 4 decimal places. Example: if cost is `0.04`, then `imagesPerDollar` is `25.0000`.

Output format:
- Return **only** a JSON array (no comments, no explanations, no markdown), exactly following the schema.
- Ensure:
  - `cost` is a number, not a string.
  - `imagesPerDollar` is a number, not a string.
  - All dates are ISO strings (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`).
  - Every object has all six fields: `model`, `updated`, `cost`, `imagesPerDollar`, `page`, `description`.
